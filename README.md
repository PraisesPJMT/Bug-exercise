# Portfolio Project

> Portfolio is one of the most powerful tools in software developer toolbox; it‚Äôs the easiest way of showing tru truly capability of the developer, and is a quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of the developer can bring to their teams.

Microverse curriculum materials requires the completion of several small projects that will combine to create a website portfolio. A portfolio website is a key job searching tool for a web developer, and I start working on it from the beginning of the Microverse program. In this project, I precisely replicate one of the portfolio templates provided. However, later on during the Microverse journey I included my own projects in the portfolio in order to use it for job searching.

## Template Choice
[Template 5](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=23%3A9) 

## GitHub Pages Deployment
During the Microverse program, I learned about different deployment tools. In Project 5, I learnt about deployment with GitHub Pages, a simple but powerful way to deploy your application. Its main advantages are:
- It's free
- It's easy and fast to start
- It's totally integrated with GitHub
- Works perfectly with small and static applications
- It has integration with a lot of tools<br>

**Upon successful deployment of the Portfolio Project on GitHub Pages, the following link can be used to view the life portfolio site.**
